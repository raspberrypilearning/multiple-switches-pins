To set the pins for multiple switches, use the following code:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: 
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 
---
switch_1 = Switch(18)
switch_2 = Switch(22)
switch_3 = Switch(28)
--- /code ---

**Tip**: You might want to give your switches variable names that relate to what they are doing. For example, `red_switch` to turn on a red light.
